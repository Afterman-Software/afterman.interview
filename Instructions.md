### Questions

1. Implement an algorithm designed to determine if there is a winner in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Given an arbitrarily long list of integers, find the most efficient way to determine if there are any duplicates (no LINQ please)
3. Create two NServiceBus endpoints.  One for Orders, and one for Email.  Use commands and events to depict an order being placed, and a resultant email being sent
  persistence and actual email sending is not required; simple objects within handlers to "mock" deeper behavior is sufficient.
